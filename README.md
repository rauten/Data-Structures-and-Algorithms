# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

Each of these files contain code I wrote for my Data Structures and Algorthims class the Fall 2015 semester. Each week, we essentially had to rewrite an already existing data structure or algorthm from scratch to give us a more complete understanding of how data structures are stored. After writing code that compiled and ran for a given method, we had to run our code against several JUnit tests to make sure all edge cases were accounted for.

In addition topics demonstrated in these files, the class also covered Stacks, Queues, Tries, HashTables, Red-Black Trees, 2-4 Trees, Splay Trees, Skip Lists, Quick Select, Greedy Algorthims, and Dynamic Programming

The number at the end of the file represents the order in which I wrote each of these programs. As I progressed throughout the semester, I used helper methods more effectively and included javadocs more frequently.
